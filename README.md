# AutoSwitch
Problem Description 

This project is a web platform which would help people to access through our website. Luxurious living has become a new trend in the town and all people prefer to have the best car near them.A country like Albania where most of the population belongs to middle-class families,most of them can’t afford a car. We have the solution for you. People have less time then force them to travel different places to work, business meeting and tourism. Also traveling with public transport is not the best choice for all of us, including traffic and the number of people inside. Apart from this feature we will like to make sure everything is automated as we would proceed with a fast manner. We will ensure the buyers the model of the car, license plate, parts of the car and everything else is guaranteed by us. Our website will include people not only companies to rent their car instead of buying a new one which we can help our buyers for this case.

Main functionalities:
1.In this app,many users can log in easily where they can create their own profile.
2.When the user signs up he will be able to check his favourite car, also we will provide every detail including the price.
3.There will be no membership fees for our choosen clients.
4.You can book a car and access to rent it 24/7 through your mobile,pc devices.
